# Hotel Reservation System

Welcome to the **Hotel Reservation System** ‚Äî a secure, JavaFX-based desktop application developed by **Almabrouk Ben-Omran** and **Abdulrahman Alhail** for the Secure Software Development course (DACS 3203-5). Designed with strong security principles and user-centric features, this application enables hotel receptionists and managers to efficiently manage room bookings, customer check-ins/check-outs, billing, feedback, and maintenance reports.

---

## üìã Project Overview

The **Hotel Reservation System** allows authorized hotel staff (Admin, Manager, Receptionist) to:

- Register users (Receptionist/Manager) and set up their profiles.
- Authenticate securely with role-based dashboard access.
- Manage room availability and customer reservations.
- Handle billing operations with secure deposit and final payments.
- Submit and review customer feedback and maintenance reports.
- Perform secure check-ins and check-outs.
- Manage customer profiles, with sensitive data (e.g., QID) encrypted.
- Log critical system actions for auditing and monitoring.

The application follows the complete Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) ‚Äî from requirements gathering and threat modeling to secure coding, SAST/DAST testing, and deployment.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication:**  
  Passwords are salted, hashed, and stored securely.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  Different system views for Admin, Manager, and Receptionist.
- **Room Reservation & Availability Management:**  
  Seamless reservation creation, modification, and cancellation.
- **Customer Profile Management:**  
  SPII (Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information) like QID is AES-encrypted.
- **Billing & Receipts:**  
  Automatic billing with initial deposit enforcement.
- **Operational Reports:**  
  Managers can review maintenance and customer feedback reports.
- **System Logging:**  
  All critical actions (e.g., cancellations, service requests) are logged securely.
- **Secure Development Practices:**  
  - Threat modeling (STRIDE/DREAD)
  - SAST via Visual Code Grepper (VCG)
  - DAST by simulating SQLi, command injection, brute-force attacks, and integer overflows.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** JavaFX
- **Database:** MySQL (managed via XAMPP's phpMyAdmin)
- **Security Libraries:** Java Cryptography Architecture (for password hashing and QID encryption)

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the application environment:

### 1. Install XAMPP
- Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- Launch **XAMPP Control Panel**.

### 2. Start Apache and MySQL
- Start both **Apache** and **MySQL** services from the XAMPP Control Panel.

### 3. Set Up the Database
- Open **phpMyAdmin** via `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
- Create a new database named `hotel`.
- Import the provided **hotel.sql** file:
  - Go to the **Import** tab.
  - Upload and execute the `hotel_database_schema/hotel.sql` file.

‚úÖ Your database, tables, and dummy data will now be ready!

### 4. Install and Configure Java MySQL Connector
To connect the Java application to the SQL server, follow these steps:

1. **Download the JDBC library**:  
   - Visit [MySQL Connector/J Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
   - Choose **Platform Independent** and download the ZIP file.
   - Unzip it. Inside the unzipped folder, locate the `mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar` file.

2. **Add JDBC library to your project**:  
   - In your IDE, go to **Project Structure**.
   - Add a **Library** that references the `mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar` file.
   - This enables you to use the JDBC API to connect and query the hotel database.

### 5. Run the Application
- Ensure you have **Java JDK** and **JavaFX SDK** installed and configured.
- Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Configure your IDE to support JavaFX.
- Verify or update the database connection settings (usually `localhost`, `root` user, no password by default for XAMPP).
- Build and run the application!
